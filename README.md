PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
          This project is an interactive animal chatbot where users can choose a virtual pet—like a cat, dog, hamster, or rabbit—and chat with them about their day, food, or sleep. Each animal responds with unique, personality-based replies, creating a fun and engaging conversation experience.

THE PROBLEM:
        We’re solving the problem of “What if I need to have a meaningful conversation with animals", for curing boredom, and making smiles.
        
THE SOLUTION:        
        We solved it by giving each pets a quirky personality, taught them how to “talk” in their own style, and set them loose in a colorful chatroom so you can ask about their day, their snacks, or their nap schedule. Basically, it’s like a pet adoption, but you just need JavaScript.

TECHNOLOGIES/COMPONENTS USED:
FOR SOFTWARE:
Here’s the tech we used to make this playful animal chatbot work:
This project was built using HTML5 to structure the animal selection cards, chat interface, and interactive elements, while CSS3 adds the vibrant gradients,       rounded corners, and playful animations that give it a fun and friendly feel. The chatbot’s logic is powered by vanilla JavaScript, which handles message sending, random response generation, and personality-based interactions for each animal. No external frameworks or libraries were used—everything is coded from scratch for a lightweight, browser-friendly experience. Development and testing were done using standard browser developer tools, making it easy to debug and fine-tune the animals’ witty responses.

FOR HARDWARE:
 The main components are:
laptop (Windows) with:
Processor: Dual-core CPU (Intel i5 / AMD equivalent or better)
RAM: 4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended for smooth multitasking)
Storage: A few MBs of free space for project files
Display: Any modern screen that can handle a resolution of 1280×720 or higher
Input devices: Keyboard and mouse/touchpad for coding and chatting with your virtual pets
          Tools required include a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) to run and test the chatbot, and optionally a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text for editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
